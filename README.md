# docker-ethminer
Automated Docker build of ethereum miner based on the cpp-ethereum build, and the (build instructions)[https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/wiki/Building-on-Ubuntu] on the official ethereum wiki for Ubuntu 14.04. 

The init.sh script by default will start a local erver; you may modify the CMD as needed to specify an IP address with -u.
